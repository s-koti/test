# Code to find the degree of profanity of each tweet

## This code indicates the degree of profanity of each tweet in a list of tweets

## Input : 
## 1) A .txt file with tweets in seperate lines, with just the tweet text without the usernames, date, time or other info on the tweet
## 2) A .txt file with words that indicate racial slurs, each one in a seperate line




## Output: 

## The degree of profanity, taken as the number of racial slurs in each tweet

### Note: This does a basic profanity check. Does not take into account words written with symbols, numbers or in combination with other words etc. Only the words in the provided .txt file are considered as slurs.
