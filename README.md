# Code to find the degree of profanity of each tweet

## This code indicates the degree of profanity of each tweet in a list of tweets

## Input : 
## 1) A .txt file with tweets in seperate lines, with just the tweet text without the usernames, date, time or other info on the tweet
## 2) A .txt file with words that indicate racial slurs, each one in a seperate line




## Output: 

## The degree of profanity, taken as the number of racial slurs in each tweet

### Note: This does a basic profanity check. It also checks for words written together. For example, "badbad" is counted as 2 words. Does not take into account words written with symbols, numbers. Only the words in the provided .txt file are considered as slurs.
